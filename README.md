<h1> About this project</h1>
<p> This project was very difficult for me and I spent every moment I was able to (outside of work and studying) working on this project. 
  With that being said, I have learned a lot about how HTML CSS and JavaScript interact. I felt very accomplished to have taught myself what I have done. </p>
  <h1> why was this difficult?<?h1>
<p> I have understood the idea of how JavaScript interacts but I am having dificulty learning how to apply it in various scenarios. unlike HTML and CSS you can lable everything differently so it is very hard to memorise what goes where.</p>

<h1> What was the purpose of this project<h1> 
<p> the purpose was to have a funtioning web API quiz that had a set timer, and kept record locally of the correct answers you chose. It was also designed to demonstrate how to succesfully write code to interact with eachother.<p/>
